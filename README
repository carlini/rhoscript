This is a compiler for rhoScript, a language designed for code golf. It is
implemented in, and compiles to, common lisp.

The code is currently reasonably stable. There are many features that are
missing from the compiler, but there are not too many known bugs.

To run the compiler, you will need SBCL <http://www.sbcl.org/> and CL-PPCRE
<http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/>.
